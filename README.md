# Parallel and Distributed Projects 💻

This repository contains two projects related to **parallel and distributed programming**. Both projects showcase the implementation of key concepts using different approaches and technologies.

## 1. **BitTorrent Protocol Simulation** 🌐
This project simulates the BitTorrent protocol using **MPI** (Message Passing Interface) and **parallel programming** techniques. It demonstrates the basics of data sharing and efficient communication in a distributed system.

## 2. **Inverted Index with MapReduce** 📚
The **Inverted Index** project implements a search index structure using **MapReduce** techniques and the **Pthreads API** in C++. This project showcases parallel processing for text data and efficiently building an index for large-scale data.

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- **MPI** (for BitTorrent simulation)  
- **Pthreads API** (for Inverted Index)  
- **C++**

These projects demonstrate the power of parallel and distributed computing for solving real-world problems efficiently.
